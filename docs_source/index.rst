**Cubrium** - A Cube in Equilibrium
===================================

Cubrium is a toolbox for the definition, solution and post-processing of homogenous loadcases in continuum mechanics of solids (statics). It uses contique for the numeric continuation of the nonlinear equilibrium equations. If you use cubrium or contique in your scientific publications, please cite my work. I'll provide a citable template with a DOI in the future.
