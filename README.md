Cubrium is a toolbox for the definition, solution and post-processing of homogenous loadcases in continuum mechanics of solids (statics).

It uses `contique` as a [contique](https://github.com/adtzlr/contique/blob/main/test/test_archimedean_spiral.py) for the numeric continuation of the nonlinear equilibrium equations.

## Example 101 a.k.a `hello cubrium` ðŸ˜Ž
This is an example which solves the Saint Venant-Kirchhoff (SVK) material for the case of uniaxial loading. In the first step, we `init` a model.

```python
import numpy as np

import cubrium
import contique

MDL = cubrium.init()
```

### Constitution
In the second part, we have to define the constitutive law. We can either use one of `cubrium`'s models or use our own `umat` (user material). This time we're using our own `umat` function for a simple SVK material.

```python
def umat_svk(F, parameters):
    """(U)ser (MAT)erial Function.
    Returns First Piola-Kirchhoff stress tensor for a given
    deformation gradient tensor with a list of material parameters."""

    # expand list of material parameters
    mu, K = parameters[:2]
    gamma = K - 2 / 3 * mu

    C = F.T @ F
    E = 1 / 2 * (C - np.eye(3))
    S = 2 * mu * E + gamma * np.trace(E) * np.eye(3)

    return F @ S
```

Now we have to link our `umat` to the `cubrium` model definition an specify material parameters.

```python
MDL.GLO.constitution.umat = umat_svk
MDL.GLO.constitution.parameters = [1.0, 5000.0]
```

### Loadcase (Kinematics and Kinetics)
A loadcase is defined with exactly **10** equations. This contains either kinematic or kinetic types of equations. For the case of uniaxial loading we are building this loadcase for ourselfes. We apply an external normal force 1 and set all external shear forces and normal forces 2 and 3 to zero. A symmetric solution is enforced (no rigid body rotation is allowed). The load-proportionaly-factor is applied to the normal forces (`lpftype=0`). Finally we specify a `title` for the loadcase. This will later effect the output filenames.

```python
def uniaxial(MDL):
    MDL.EXT.force.normal[0] = 1
    MDL.EXT.force.normal[1] = 0
    MDL.EXT.force.normal[2] = 0

    MDL.EXT.force.shear[0, 1] = 0
    MDL.EXT.force.shear[1, 2] = 0
    MDL.EXT.force.shear[0, 2] = 0

    MDL.EXT.gridvec.symmetry = [1, 1, 1]

    MDL.GLO.lpftype = 0
    MDL.GLO.title = "Uniaxial"
    return MDL
```

Again, we have to link our loadcase to the `cubrium` model and update the model with the new loadcase settings.

```python
MDL = uniaxial(MDL)
MDL = cubrium.update(MDL)
```

### Solver
Starting from a valid initial solution

```python
x0   = np.zeros(9)
lpf0 = 0.0
```

everything is ready to solve the model in `contique`. **Hint**: `x0` are the components of the displacement gradient w.r.t. the undeformed coordinates (=primary unknows of the problem).

```python
    Res = contique.solve(
        fun  = cubrium.assembly.equilibrium,
        x0   = x0,
        lpf0 = lpf0,
        args = (MDL,),
    )
```

The results contain the extended unknowns `y = (x, lpf)` but no information about the internal quantities of the model. Next we extract the extended unknowsfrom the `Result` object and recover these internal quantities (e.g. reaction forces) for all steps.

```python
Y = np.array([res.x for res in Res])
history = cubrium.recover(Y, MDL)
```

### Plots and Post-processing
We plot the axial stretch vs. load-proportionality-factor in direction 1.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.plot(1+Y[:, 0], Y[:, -1], "-")
plt.xlabel("stretch $\lambda_1$")
plt.ylabel("load-proportionality-factor LPF")
```

Using `meshio` we are able to export our solution in the `xdmf` file format which may be further post-processed by ParaView.

```python
cubrium.writer.xdmf(
        history,
        filename = MDL.GLO.title,
    )
```

An exemplary scene for ParaView 5.9.0 is available to download. Import it in ParaView and choose "select input files" as shown below. Voila - a nice cube animation with a cube colored in "Cauchy stress XX" and reaction forces scaled and colored in "reaction force XX".
